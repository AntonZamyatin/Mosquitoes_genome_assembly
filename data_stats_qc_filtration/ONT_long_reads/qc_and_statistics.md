We used NanoStat for data QC and statistics gathering and NanoPlot for visualisation. These tools are from [nanopack tools](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanopack)

### NanoStat
```
READS=[filename of ONT data .fastq]
OUTDIR=[path to output]

NanoStat --fastq $READS --outdir $OUTDIR
```
Nanostat outputs main statistics for the read data. Example from our library:

```
General summary:        
Mean read length:                 8,509.6
Mean read quality:                   10.1
Median read length:               3,833.0
Median read quality:                 10.3
Number of reads:              3,299,012.0
Read length N50:                 19,315.0
Total bases:             28,073,279,865.0

### NanoPlot

```
READS=[filename of ONT data .fastq]
OUTDIR=[path to output]

NanoPlot --raw -o $OUTDIR -f png,tiff --fastq $READS 
```
